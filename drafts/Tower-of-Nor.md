## on the Isle of the Elder Bee

*Imagine that Whence why you sense all of Sound and
Those spectrums of Lightning and that Odour around
Waves sear from the Stars making Tremors in Ground
Within mights from all Metals most Magicallii bound!*

---

And what then,
If you do grasp the true All? 
All Sound in its size; Lightning's surprise? 
That Odour impure within Pheromone's lure?
Ancient Fires and Ices waged in warring devices?
Wanderous Tremor through Ground and the Seas
Birthing forces fled forth from the flowers and trees? 
Revealed is that mad-myriad, Nature's Name --
As our Wailingly Woon grasps 
Truth thus the Same?

How would you choose then, how to know what is True? 

How would you know what to know about *you*?

[A silence, moon's light a-fixed on a face rapt in thought]

Would you shut close those eyes (to give Lightning disguise),  
and wrap tight your ears from all Sound? 

Would you wear a wood pin (to pinch your nose in), 
Then find shelter from Air as you drop still to the Ground?

Would this so still that fierce-frightful heart?

 Is this then the How you would choose to depart?

As you lay all alone -- wrapped up, put down.

Give in to your Self to lie -- and to sink.

[A salted bead of moon-lit dew]

Then How would you think?

And What would you do?

[A clock ticks, but once]

Who would you *be*?

If not you?

[A beat]

*Here* is the **Naught**.

[A sigh, and then two... and then the last few]

As you forsake All of your *feeling*...  
*Then what feels for You*?

---

Could you then better feel these currents of air,  
and the ripples through rock beneath your old bones? 

Might you too tune those low, and go so much further below, 
At one with the very most Ancient of Stones?

Dig you down for your own beating heart.
I had you the spade and the lamp. 

The gravity grabs you and hurries your pace -
You haven't much longer in this cavernous place.

You drop down to the chamber of magmatic blood
Beats your heart like the Earth from whence it arose

You're now gone from the place where the Surface fears found you
And follow the thumping of that which has bound you

That rushed red-thick blood flowing Chambers to Pate, 
There's **Naught** but the Source that enslaves left to hate -



You run through It's there through these corridors, 
You've found your way in through the Tower of Nor!

 to the mind which wandered itself there? Could it hear its own call to be calmed? Calmed down, down into your Self, your Heart, your Thought, away from the clamoured calls of all those things about you, those worlds without you?

Would you descend and still fall faster past the circles and circles of concern, down and past and ever-in, until you were but the quiet eye of the Storm?

Would that be whence you are? All eye and no form? 

Are you always dwelling there, just ever unaware?

Or,

Would you in stead throw wide what gifts of sights all-dimensioned - breathing your Self out into the calling clamour of the Material's great glamour -- the community of the Coarse?

Rake it all in about you, making your Self enlarged as a force?

Would you drink in all the movings of mediums, those vibrations and flows that we name as feelings? Would you haul yourself toward them in every compass direction, and become these very things, to indwell? 

Would you assume every nature, exchanging your being with the Being around your heart, and head, and lungs, and limbs, and cast wide every small part of you to do the same, at last exploding into all that you envision, in every expanding sense, soaring faster out and away?

Once you are everywhence, where can you stay?

Would you become both the Rain and the Moon? The rim of the Dawn? The wail of the Woon?

Would it shock you to your expanding core to witness what is seen by the Star, for that eternal moment whence you are all that you are?

The Eye beyond Storm, you are now but the Naught once again - only begotten of Thought in a moment too small to rest on a pin.

And where have you gone where you have left all that you were?

TBD ...

As you forsake All of your *being*...  
*Then what becomes You*?

---

The Oracle falls silent, the wizard released from its reverious wake, and the corpse collapses to the stone floor, enfolding in volumous robes -- a gnarled staff clatters into the shadows to lay with the staves and other castaway bones of Seekers past. 

*There is always a space in the Tower of Nor for the staves and the bones of the wizards galore.*

In a moon's beam from the small crescent window above the Oracle, dust motes swirl and dance in joyful thanks -- another mind once imprisoned by grasping desire of the ungraspable, now free, and clear. The Motes too soon settle, moonlight once again untarnished.

In the still of the Oracle's silo, time returns to its secret repose, and the world beyond the lone window begins again its slowlii spin.

*A clock hung Here will tick for Naught
The Tear will cling to crescent cloak
All Air will lay with Ground to rot
No Mordibund will be to croak*

Hilo the common Hooded Rat sits still with the shadows, behind the skull of a nameless mage-no-more, and chewing upon a mouldering cheese, beholds the Oracle of Nor. His food is dwindling. Perhaps this latest wizard has brought with them some cheese or other treat. Even wizards have to eat. Most of them, at least. 

Hilo scans the rounded room -- no corners for him or other things to hide within - only the untouched shadow enshrouding the walls of the small circular space. He has never seen the ceiling of this place - it is perfect dark up there. From the sounds of it though, and the thin way the air moves if tested with a stone's throw, (as he sometimes does), he knows roughly where the roof is set -- he knows he is on the uppermost floor, for the winds outside could be heard to howl there the hardest, when the greylit gales sweep in sharp from the Coast, not far West of the Tower of Nor. 

The tower is the house of the Oracle -- and that of the Rat unhinged enough to seek escape from the uncountable dangers without, by harbouring within its haunted frame. Hilo has never met another rat in the Tower, nor any other living thing greater than the Ant - not a cat deranged, nor Crow estranged -- not one small snake or other stirring thing -- not even a mad mouse. So safe admist the Sinister, is the common Rat -- and so uncommon in that is Hilo. He has never convinced another of his kind to follow him in; the curse of the place known even to his most superstition-less kin.
