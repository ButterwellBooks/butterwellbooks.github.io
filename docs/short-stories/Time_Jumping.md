It's been about 53 years since I landed my last jump, which will launch in late October 2058, about 35 years from now. I'm a time traveller.

I entered the machine with a **stickum**1 stuck to the roof of my mouth, with unclaimed Lotto-649 winning numbers from 1989 through 1992 printed on it, arranged like a bunch of phone numbers. 

This is against the Rules, of course. I wasn't the first to try something like that. 

It didn't work out anyway.

So I work part-time as security guard at a bottling plant. I guard bottles, bottling equipment, and various liquids bound for bottling. I help ensure the uninterrupted flow of booze and pop to my fellow so-called Canadians (You're welcome).

My plan had been to fix some societal problems with a few formerly unclaimed lotto windfalls, then spend my days in a sturdy shelter somewhere safe, writing poems and learning how to grow things for soup. That was the reasonable dream.

Here's a tidbit they don't tell you about time travel, while you’re signing the waivers: you land in the past as a *fetus*. 

If survive your new, random human life for a few decades, decide to develop the right mindset, and figure out how to follow curious paths, you might start to remember that you come from the future.

This implausible notion comes knocking quietly in dreams at first, easily dismissed. Then, by serendipities of increasing frequency, harder to ignore. Eventually, as signals left lying about, right where you'll certainly find them, increasingly perplexing.

One day, you get approached by people who offer to fill you in on some specifics. By then, you're *just* about ready to believe what they've got to say. Almost.

It's a keen moment - your admission to a stranger universe still, or messy retreat into mental metldown. I’m told it comes down to a coin toss.

I'm skipping a bulk load of existential crisis stuff, clearly. It helps if you happen to follow fiction that normalizes the abnormal; Having seen *Back to the Future*, etc.

Over the course of this journey through thinking that you're probably going crazy - and then on to wondering whether it's *reality,* and not you, who's the truly crazy one - you are at last led to recall that you came here with a *mission*.

Everything you had thought you were taking with you into that machine - all the schemes and certainties and selfish motives - won’t come out the other side with you. These things just don't *fit* where you're about to go.

"Time machines" - at least the kind commonly known in 2058 - have very small apertures; just enough to squeeze a bit of DNA wrapped in some electro-magnetic fluff, fuelled (or something) by a microscopic ball of Vanadium.2 

This sounds made up, whatever. I don't understand the particulars. I wasn't science-minded in my previous future life, and I'm sure not about to start now.
